# Analyze A/B Test Results

## Project Scope
For this project, I will be working to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. 
The company has developed a new web page in order to try and increase the number of users who "convert," meaning the number of users who decide to pay for the company's product. 
The goal is to work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should implement this new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

## Techniques

In this assignment I used a variety of different techniques to understand and figure out whether or not the new page should be implemented.
The following is the workflow I used:
- Define the hypothesis test
- Create the user groups
- Solve for the p-value
- Create alternative hypothesis to validate initial approach
- Regression Approach: Using regressions to understand if the new page is truly better
    - Assessing other variables if they will influence conversions


## Result

We found that through our regressional analysis that the new page wasn't better at converting.
